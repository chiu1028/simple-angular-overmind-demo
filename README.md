# simple-angular-overmind-demo

This a simple project which apply overmind on angular. In addition, I also use 'overmind-devtools' to monitor the states in overmind.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

## How to run this project
1. npm install
2. node node_modules/electron/install.js
3. npm start 
    1. will run a dev server
    2. will open page `http://localhost:4200/`
    3. will open Electron tool, which will monitor the states in overmind
 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
